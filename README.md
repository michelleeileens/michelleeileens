# Hey, I'm Michelle

CS @ University of Maryland | Building things at the intersection of AI, data, and product.

I care about building products people actually want to use—and understanding the systems that power them.

## What I'm Working On

**[StudyEZ](https://github.com/michelleeileens/studyez)** — AI-powered lecture companion that transforms recordings into organized notes, summaries, and learning resources. Built at Bitcamp 2025 with React, Flask, MongoDB, and Google Gemini.

**[LLM Fine-tuning](https://github.com/michelleeileens/llm-finetuning-llama)** — Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 using LoRA and Unsloth. Exploring how to make LLMs more useful for specific domains.
